  abstract = {High-order-accurate methods for viscous flow problems have the potential to reduce the computational effort required for a given level of solution accuracy. The state of the art in this area is more advanced for structured mesh methods and finite-element methods than for unstructured mesh finite-volume methods. In this paper, we present and analyze a new approach for high-order-accurate finite-volume discretization for diffusive fluxes that is based on the gradients computed during solution reconstruction. Our analysis results show that our schemes based on linear and cubic reconstruction can be reasonably expected to achieve second- and fourth-order accuracy in practice, respectively, while schemes based on quadratic reconstruction are expected to be only second-order accurate in practice. Numerical experiments show that in fact nominal accuracy is attained in all cases for two advection–diffusion problems, provided that curved boundaries are properly represented. To enforce boundary conditions on curved boundaries, we introduce a technique for constraining the least-squares reconstruction in boundary control volumes. Simply put, we require that the reconstructed solution satisfy the boundary condition exactly at all boundary flux integration points. Numerical experiments demonstrate the success of this approach, both in the reconstruction results and in simulation results.},

  abstract = {The multislope concept has been recently introduced in the literature to deal with MUSCL reconstructions on triangular and tetrahedral unstructured meshes in the finite volume cell-centered context. Dedicated scalar slopes are used to compute the interpolations on each face of a given element, in opposition to the monoslope methods in which a unique limited gradient is used. The multislope approach reveals less expensive and potentially more accurate than the classical gradient techniques. Besides, it may also help the robustness when dealing with hyperbolic systems involving complex solutions, with large discontinuities and high density ratios. However some important limitations on the mesh topology still have to be overcome with the initial multislope formalism. In this paper, a generalized multislope MUSCL method is introduced for cell-centered finite volume discretizations. The method is freed from constraints on the mesh topology, thereby operating on completely general unstructured meshes. Moreover optimal second-order accuracy is reached at the faces centroids. The scheme can be written with nonnegative coefficients, which makes it L∞-stable. Special attention has also been paid to equip the reconstruction procedure with well-adapted dedicated limiters, potentially CFL-dependent. Numerical tests are provided to prove the ability of the method to deal with completely general meshes, while exhibiting second-order accuracy.},

  abstract = {The number of ordinary differential equations generally increases exponentially as the partial differential equation is posed on a domain with more dimensions. This is, of course, the curse of dimensionality for exponential time differencing methods. The computational challenge in applying exponential time differencing methods for solving partial differential equations in high spatial dimensions is how to compute the matrix exponential functions for very large matrices accurately and efficiently. In this paper, our main aim is to design a Krylov subspace approximation-based locally extrapolated exponential time differencing method and compare its performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency to the already available method in the literature for solving a three-dimensional nonlinear advection-diffusion-reaction systems. The fundamental idea of the proposed method is to compute only the action of the matrix exponential on a given state vector instead of computing the matrix exponential itself, and then multiplying it with given vector. The stability and local truncation error of the proposed method have been examined. Calculation of local truncation error and empirical convergence analysis indicate the proposed method is second-order accurate in time. The performance and reliability of this novel method have been investigated by testing it on systems of the three-dimensional nonlinear advection-diffusion-reaction equations and three-dimensional viscous nonlinear Burgers’ equation.},

Simply using a Krylov method is much less effective, especially when the wave number in the Helmholtz operator becomes large, and also algebraic preconditioners such as incomplete LU factorizations do not remedy the situation. Even more powerful preconditioners such as classical domain decomposition and multigrid methods fail to lead to a convergent method, and often behave differently from their usual behavior for positive definite problems. For example increasing the overlap in a classical Schwarz method degrades its performance, as does increasing the number of smoothing steps in multigrid. The purpose of this review paper is to explain why classical iterative methods fail to be effective for Helmholtz problems, and to show different avenues that have been taken to address this difficulty.},

  abstract   = {Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information.},

  abstract = {When explicit time discretization schemes are applied to stiff reaction–diffusion equations, the stability constraint on the time step depends on two terms: the diffusion and the reaction. The part of the stability constraint due to diffusion can be totally removed if the linear diffusions are treated exactly using integration factor (IF) or exponential time differencing (ETD) methods. For systems with severely stiff reactions, those methods are not efficient because the reaction terms in IF or ETD are still approximated with explicit schemes. In this paper, we introduce a new class of semi-implicit schemes, which treats the linear diffusions exactly and explicitly, and the nonlinear reactions implicitly. A distinctive feature of the scheme is the decoupling between the exact evaluation of the diffusion terms and implicit treatment of the nonlinear reaction terms. As a result, the size of the nonlinear system arising from the implicit treatment of the reactions is independent of the number of spatial grid points; it only depends on the number of original equations, unlike the case in which standard implicit temporal schemes are directly applied to the reaction–diffusion system. The stability region for this class of methods is much larger than existing methods using an explicit treatment of reaction terms. In particular, the one with second order accuracy is unconditionally linearly stable with respect to both diffusion and reaction. Direct numerical simulations on test equations, as well as morphogen systems from developmental biology, show the new semi-implicit schemes are efficient, robust and accurate.},

  abstract = {Multigrid and domain decomposition methods provide efficient algorithms for the numerical solution of partial differential equations arising in the modelling of many applications in Computational Science and Engineering. This manuscript covers certain aspects of  modern iterative solution methods for the solution of large-scale problems issued from the discretization of partial differential equations. More specifically, we focus on geometric multigrid methods, non-overlapping substructuring methods and flexible Krylov subspace methods with a particular emphasis on their combination. Firstly, the combination of multigrid and Krylov subspace methods is investigated on a linear partial differential equation modelling wave propagation in heterogeneous media. Secondly, we focus on non-overlapping domain decomposition methods for a specific finite element discretization known as the hp finite element, where unrefinement/refinement is allowed both by decreasing/increasing the step size h or by decreasing/increasing the polynomial degree p of the approximation on each element. Results on condition number bounds for the domain decomposition preconditioned operators are given and illustrated by numerical results on academic problems in two and three dimensions. Thirdly, we review recent advances related to a class of Krylov subspace methods allowing variable preconditioning. We examine in detail flexible Krylov subspace methods including augmentation and/or spectral deflation, where deflation aims at capturing approximate invariant subspace information. We also present flexible Krylov subspace methods for the solution of linear systems with multiple right-hand sides given simultaneously. The efficiency of the numerical methods is demonstrated on challenging applications in seismics requiring the solution of huge linear systems of equations with multiple right-hand sides on parallel distributed memory computers. Finally, we expose current and future prospectives towards the design of efficient algorithms on extreme scale machines for the solution of problems coming from the discretization of partial differential equations.},

  abstract = {Efficient simulation of multiphysics problems is a challenging task. This is often due to the multiscale nature of the physics and nonlinear coupling between the different processes. One approach to this problem is to solve the entire multiphysics problem simultaneously in a fully coupled manner. However, due to the strong coupling and multiphysics interactions, it is difficult to design and analyze fully coupled solvers, which often entail the construction and solution of global fully coupled Jacobian systems. Another approach is the sequential-implicit method, whereby the full multiphysics problem is split into different subproblems. Each subproblem is constructed and solved separately; then the solutions of the subproblems are stitched together in a specific sequence. Isolation of each subproblem allows for the design of specialized solvers that tackle the complexity of the particular subproblem efficiently. The sequential-implicit approach offers wide flexibility and extensibility. However, these advantages are often offset by slow convergence rates when there is strong coupling between the subproblems. This slow convergence rate of the overall coupled system is directly linked to the use of a fixed-point outer-loop iteration in sequential-implicit methods. We present a Sequential Implicit Newton (SIN) approach, whereby the sequence of implicit subproblems is wrapped with an outer full Newton scheme. We demonstrate that the SIN formulation improves the overall convergence rate from linear to quadratic. The SIN method uses the same sequential-implicit scheme as the fixed-point method, but after each sequential iteration a Newton update is computed. Wrapping a Newton loop around the traditional sequential-implicit scheme leads to significant improvements in the convergence rate. The SIN method allows for the ability to split a multiphysics problem into individual subproblems while taking advantage of the quadratic convergence rate of the Newton method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SIN using two different multiphysics porous-media problems: flow-thermal in geothermal reservoir simulation and flow-mechanics in geomechanics reservoir simulation. Just as with the fixed-point iteration version of the sequential-implicit method, SIN benefits from careful design of the constraints used to stitch the sequence of the subproblems. Our numerical experiments show that the SIN approach improves the overall convergence rate for all the nonlinear multiphysics problems considered. For specific cases where there is strong nonlinear coupling between the subproblems, we see up to two orders of magnitude decrease in the number of sequential iterations when using SIN compared with the fixed-iteration scheme.},

  abstract  = {This work introduces a general framework for constructing high-order, linearly stable, partitioned solvers for multiphysics problems from a monolithic implicit–explicit Runge–Kutta (IMEX-RK) discretization of the semi-discrete equations. The generic multiphysics problem is modeled as a system of n systems of partial differential equations where the ith subsystem is coupled to the other subsystems through a coupling term that can depend on the state of all the other subsystems. This coupled system of partial differential equations reduces to a coupled system of ordinary differential equations via the method of lines where an appropriate spatial discretization is applied to each subsystem. The coupled system of ordinary differential equations is taken as a monolithic system and discretized using an IMEX-RK discretization with a specific implicit–explicit decomposition that introduces the concept of a predictor for the coupling term. We propose four coupling predictors that enable the monolithic system to be solved in a partitioned manner, i.e., subsystem-by-subsystem, and preserve the IMEX-RK structure and therefore the design order of accuracy of the monolithic scheme. The four partitioned solvers that result from these predictors are high-order accurate, allow for maximum re-use of existing single-physics software, and two of the four solvers allow the subsystems to be solved in parallel at a given stage and time step. We also analyze the stability of a coupled, linear model problem with a specific coupling structure and show that one of the partitioned solvers achieves unconditional linear stability for this problem, while the others are unconditionally stable only for certain values of the coupling strength. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed partitioned solvers on several classes of multiphysics problems including a simple linear system of ODEs, advection–diffusion–reaction systems, fluid–structure interaction problems, and particle-laden flows, where we verify the design order of the IMEX schemes and study various stability properties.},

The aim of the present paper is to investigate the behavior of implicit linearized schemes in this context. A finite-volume method is considered and second-order accuracy in space is obtained through MUSCL reconstruction. A second-order time accurate explicit version of the scheme is obtained through a two step Runge-Kutta method. Implicit linearized schemes of second-order of accuracy in time are derived thanks to a BDF method associated with a Defect Correction technique. The different time-advancing schemes are compared, using a 2D sediment transport problem, with different types of flow/bed interactions. The implicit one largely outperforms the explicit version for slow flow/bed interactions while in the case of fast flow/bed interactions, the CPU time of both time integration schemes are comparable. Thus, the implicit scheme turns out to be a good candidate to simulate flows with sediment transport in practical applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an efficient and highly-parallelizable preconditioning technique for Newton–Krylov solvers. The proposed method can be viewed as a generalization of the implicit line smoothing technique by extending the groups of implicitly-solved unknowns from lines to blocks. The blocks are formed by partitioning the computational domain such that the strong connections between unknowns are not broken by the partition boundaries. The ILU algorithm is used to obtain an approximate (or exact) factorization for each block. Then, a block-Jacobi iteration is formulated in which the degrees of freedom within the blocks are solved implicitly. To stabilize the iterations for high-CFL systems, a dual-CFL strategy, with a lower CFL in the preconditioner matrix, is developed. The performance of the proposed method as a linear preconditioner is demonstrated for second- and third-order steady-state solutions of Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations on the NASA Common Research Model (CRM), including the high-lift configuration. For the studied test cases, it is shown that in comparison with the traditional ILU(k) method, the proposed preconditioner requires significantly less memory and it can result in notably faster solutions.},

Computational and storage constraints usually force the method to be restarted after a fixed (small) number of iterations with subsequent loss of monotonic convergence properties. Trouble may be caused by the presence of eigenvalues close to the origin which are not well detected by early restarts. Unlike recent techniques that propose to include this information in later restarts, we use a new formulation of GMRES to derive a simple variant of the algorithm. The new approach attempts to mitigate stagnation by exploiting the smoothness of a certain polynomial near zero, resorting to the original method once convergence becomes truly monotonic.

We characterize the set of matrices B that, with the given vector v, generate the same spaces; i.e., those matrices B for which BKk(B,v) = AKk(A,v), for all k = 1, {\ldots}, n. It is shown that any such sequence of spaces can be generated by a unitary matrix. If zero is outside the field of values of A, then there is a Hermitian positive definite matrix that generates the same spaces, and, moreover, if A is close to Hermitian then there is a nearby Hermitian matrix that generates the same spaces. It is also shown that any such sequence of spaces can be generated by a matrix having any desired eigenvalues.},

For high polynomial degrees, assembling the matrix for the linear systems resulting from the finite element discretization can be prohibitively expensive, both in terms of computational complexity and memory. For this reason, it is necessary to develop matrix-free operators and preconditioners, which can be used to efficiently solve these linear systems without access to the matrix entries themselves. The matrix-free operator evaluations utilize GPU-accelerated sum-factorization techniques to minimize memory movement and maximize throughput. The preconditioners developed in this work are based on a low-order refined methodology with parallel subspace corrections, as described for diffusion problems in [1]. The saddle-point Stokes system is solved using block-preconditioning techniques, which are robust in mesh size, polynomial degree, time step, and viscosity. For the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we make use of projection (fractional step) methods, which require Helmholtz and Poisson solves at each time step. The performance of our flow solvers is assessed on several benchmark problems in two and three spatial dimensions.},

A new formulation using characteristic wave relations through boundaries is derived for the Euler equations and generalized to the Navier-Stokes equations. The emphasis is on deriving boundary conditions compatible with modern non-dissipative algorithms used for direct simulations of turbulent flows. These methods have very low dispersion errors and require precise boundary conditions to avoid numerical instabilities and to control spurious wave reflections at the computational boundaries. The present formulation is an attempt to provide such conditions. Reflecting and non-reflecting boundary condition treatments are presented. Examples of practical implementations for inlet and outlet boundaries as well as slip and no-slip walls are presented. The method applies to subsonic and supersonic flows. It is compared with a reference method based on extrapolation and partial use of Riemann invariants. Test cases described include a ducted shear layer, vortices propagating through boundaries, and Poiseuille flow. Although no mathematical proof of well-posedness is given, the method uses the correct number of boundary conditions required for well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations and the examples reveal that it provides a significant improvement over the reference method.},

The finite volume method is a discretization method that is well suited for the numerical simulation of various types (for instance, elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic) of conservation laws; it has been extensively used in several engineering fields, such as fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, or petroleum engineering. Some of the important features of the finite volume method are similar to those of the finite element method: it may be used on arbitrary geometries, using structured or unstructured meshes, and it leads to robust schemes. The finite volume method is locally conservative because it is based on a “balance" approach: a local balance is written on each discretization cell that is often called “control volume;” by the divergence formula, an integral formulation of the fluxes over the boundary of the control volume is then obtained. The fluxes on the boundary are discretized with respect to the discrete unknowns.},

  abstract = {Abstract One of the most powerful tools for solving large and sparse systems of linear algebraic equations is a class of iterative methods called Krylov subspace methods. Their significant advantages like low memory requirements and good approximation properties make them very popular, and they are widely used in applications throughout science and engineering. The use of the Krylov subspaces in iterative methods for linear systems is even counted among the “Top 10” algorithmic ideas of the 20th century. Convergence analysis of these methods is not only of a great theoretical importance but it can also help to answer practically relevant questions about improving the performance of these methods. As we show, the question about the convergence behavior leads to complicated nonlinear problems. Despite intense research efforts, these problems are not well understood in some cases. The goal of this survey is to summarize known convergence results for three well-known Krylov subspace methods (CG, MINRES and GMRES) and to formulate open questions in this area.

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with time-stepping numerical methods for computing stiff semi-discrete systems of ordinary differential equations for transient hypersonic flows with thermo-chemical nonequilibrium. The stiffness of the equations is mainly caused by the viscous flux terms across the boundary layers and by the source terms modeling finite-rate thermo-chemical processes. Implicit methods are needed to treat the stiff terms while more efficient explicit methods can still be used for the nonstiff terms in the equations. This paper studies three different semi-implicit Runge–Kutta methods for additively split differential equations in the form ofu′ =f(u) +g(u), wherefis treated by explicit Runge–Kutta methods andgis simultaneously treated by three implicit Runge–Kutta methods: a diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta method and two linearized implicit Runge–Kutta methods. The coefficients of up to third-order accurate additive semi-implicit Runge–Kutta methods have been derived such that the methods are both high-order accurate and strongly A-stable for the implicit terms. The results of two numerical tests on the stability and accuracy properties of these methods are also presented in the paper.},

It is shown that the proposed technique can accurately model such problems eliminating the need to use expensive classical dual-timestepping time-accurate integration. Furthermore, for autonomous dynamical systems subjected to single or multiple fundamental frequencies, the C-TSM analysis can be used without the prior knowledge of those frequencies. This offers an apparent advantage over the Fourier-based time-spectral methods. In addition, the current approach lends itself as a very useful tool for transient adjoint-based sensitivity analysis since it greatly reduces the memory requirements by solving and storing time-dependent response at a handful of collocation points instead of storing the entire time-history of the primal solution. The efficacy of the present technique is demonstrated by directly comparing the results with Fourier-based time-spectral, as well as time-accurate methods.},

Cette méthode, basée sur un schéma d'Euler, combine des résolutions grossières et des résolutions fines et indépendantes en temps en s'inspirant de ce qui est classique en espace. La parallélisation qui en résulte se fait dans la direction temporelle ce qui est en revanche non classique. Elle a pour principale motivation les problèmes en temps réel, d'où la terminologie proposée de «pararéel ». The purpose of this Note is to propose a time discretization of a partial differential evolution equation that allows for parallel implementations. The method, based on an Euler scheme, combines coarse resolutions and independent fine resolutions in time in the same spirit as standard spacial approximations. The resulting parallel implementation is done in the non standard time direction. Its main goal concerns real time problems, hence the proposed terminology of “parareal” algorithm.},

The convergence properties of such exponential integrators are analyzed, and potential sources of numerical instabilities are identified. In particular, it is shown that local linearization gives rise to better stability for stiff problems. A number of numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract = {We develop a fully implicit scheme for the Navier–Stokes equations, in conservative form, for low to intermediate Mach number flows. Simulations in this range of flow regime produce stiff wave systems in which slow dynamical (advective) modes coexist with fast acoustic modes. Viscous and thermal diffusion effects in refined boundary layers can also produce stiffness. Implicit schemes allow one to step over the fast wave phenomena (or unresolved viscous time scales), while resolving advective time scales. In this study we employ the Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) method and develop a new physics-based preconditioner. To aid in overcoming numerical stiffness caused by the disparity between acoustic and advective modes, the governing equations are transformed into the primitive-variable form in a preconditioning step. The physics-based preconditioning incorporates traditional semi-implicit and physics-based splitting approaches without a loss of consistency between the original and preconditioned systems. The resulting algorithm is capable of solving low-speed natural circulation problems (M∼10-4) with significant heat flux as well as intermediate speed (M∼1) flows efficiently by following dynamical (advective) time scales of the problem.},

This paper studies the solution of partitioned systems of differential equations using exponential Runge-Kutta methods. We propose specific multiphysics implementations of exponential Runge-Kutta methods satisfying stiff order conditions that were developed in Hochbruck et al. (1998) [22] and Luan and Osterman (2014) [25]. We reformulate stiffly–accurate exponential Runge–Kutta methods in a way that naturally allows of the structure of multiphysics systems, and discuss their application to both component and additively partitioned systems. The resulting partitioned exponential methods only compute matrix functions of the Jacobians of individual components, rather than the Jacobian of the full, coupled system. We derive modified formulations of particular methods of order two, three and four, and apply them to solve a partitioned reaction-diffusion problem. The proposed methods retain full order for several partitionings of the discretized problem, including by components and by physical processes.},

Savings of approximately 50\% can be achieved for simulations of the three-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations while still maintaining a truncation error typical of explicit time-stepping schemes. Exponential time integration techniques of this type are particularly advantageous for fluid flows with a wide range of temporal scales such as low-Mach number, reactive or acoustically dominated flows.

  abstract = {We present an arbitrarily high-order, conditionally stable, partitioned spectral deferred correction (SDC) method for solving multiphysics problems using a sequence of pre-existing single-physics solvers. This method extends the work in [1], [2], which used implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods (IMEX) to build high-order, partitioned multiphysics solvers. We consider a generic multiphysics problem modeled as a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), coupled through coupling terms that can depend on the state of each subsystem; therefore the method applies to both a semi-discretized system of partial differential equations (PDEs) or problems naturally modeled as coupled systems of ODEs. The sufficient conditions to build arbitrarily high-order partitioned SDC schemes are derived. Based on these conditions, various of partitioned SDC schemes are designed. The stability of the first-order partitioned SDC scheme is analyzed in detail on a coupled, linear model problem. We show that the scheme is conditionally stable, and under conditions on the coupling strength, the scheme can be unconditionally stable. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed partitioned solvers on several classes of multiphysics problems with moderate coupling strength. They include a stiff linear system of ODEs, advection-diffusion-reaction systems, and fluid-structure interaction problems with both incompressible and compressible flows, where we verify the design order of the SDC schemes and study various stability properties. We also directly compare the accuracy, stability, and cost of the proposed partitioned SDC solver with the partitioned IMEX method in [1], [2] on this suite of test problems. The results suggest that the high-order partitioned SDC solvers are more robust than the partitioned IMEX solvers for the numerical examples considered in this work, while the IMEX methods require fewer implicit solves.},

Studies were made at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory of the shock detachment distance on spheres fired in a small aerophysics range. This chapter presents an experimental measurement of shock detachment distance on spheres fired in air at hypervelocities. It presents the results from some of the shock detachment measurements obtained on spheres fired into air. The experimental program was conducted in a small aerophysics range, 30 ft long, equipped with a two-stage light gas launcher and high-speed optical and radiation instrumentation. Investigations of this type can yield accurate information about the thermodynamic state variables of high temperature air in equilibrium as well as a check of the calculated values available in the literature. Moreover, if the density is sufficiently low, then the shock detachment distance becomes a measure of the lag in the exchange between the energy of translational motion and the internal modes and chemical reactions.},

The mathematical model includes equations of gas dynamics, equations of the turbulence model and equations of chemical kinetics. A critical review of the various models that are used to find the stand-off distance is provided. The results of numerical calculations on the distribution of flow quantities in the shock layer and the stand-off distance at different freestream Mach numbers are presented. The results of numerical calculations in a wide range of freestream Mach numbers are compared with the experimental data and computational results of other researchers. Standoff distance is computed at various Mach number and heights during a flight in the atmosphere at hypersonic speed.},

  abstract = {A key problem that has remained unsolved for the past quarter-century is presently compromising the accuracy of heat transfer predictions made by numerical simulations of hypersonic flow. This numerical difficulty is called the carbuncle problem, a local unpleasant displacement of the bow shock wave shape. It is most prominent in computational fluid dynamics simulations within the blunt nose region of an aerodynamic vehicle on axisymmetric grids. Most efforts to remedy this problem have concerned the numerical treatment of the bow shock wave: both the algorithm calculating the discontinuities across the bow shock wave and the alignment of the computational mesh with the shock wave location. Although these efforts have improved simulation accuracy, none have yet removed the problem. The fundamental requirement of any numerical procedure is that it has sufficient numerical dissipation to control error growth. All methods contain it, and an unintended consequence will be shown to be its contribution to the carbuncle problem. This paper will analyze solution algorithm procedures, in particular their inherent numerical dissipation and application on axisymmetric grids, to determine the cause of and remedy for the carbuncle problem.},

The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series “Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.”},

The analysis is performed in an abstract Banach space framework of sectorial operators and locally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities. We commence by giving a new and short derivation of the classical (nonstiff) order conditions for exponential Runge--Kutta methods, but the main interest of our paper lies in the stiff case. By expanding the errors of the numerical method in terms of the solution, we derive new order conditions that form the basis of our error bounds for parabolic problems. We show convergence for methods up to order four, and we analyze methods that were recently presented in the literature. These methods have classical order four, but they do not satisfy some of the new conditions. Therefore, an order reduction is expected. We present numerical experiments which show that this order reduction in fact arises in practical examples. Based on our new conditions, we finally construct methods that do not suffer from order reduction.},

In contrast to standard integrators, the methods are fully explicit and do not require the numerical solution of linear systems. We analyze the convergence properties of these integrators in a semigroup framework of semilinear evolution equations in Banach spaces. In particular, we derive an abstract stability and convergence result for variable step sizes. This analysis further provides the required order conditions and thus allows us to construct pairs of embedded methods. We present a third-order method with two stages, and a fourth-order method with three stages, respectively. The application of the required matrix functions to vectors are computed by Krylov subspace approximations.

The computational cost of this implicit scheme for large systems, however, is very high since it requires solving a nonlinear system at every step. Surprisingly, in this work we show that one can construct and prove convergence results for exponential methods of order four which use two stages only. Specifically, we derive two new fourth-order two-stage exponential Rosenbrock schemes for solving large systems of differential equations. Moreover, since the newly schemes are not only superconvergent but also fully explicit, they turn out to be very competitive compared to the two-stage Gauss–Legendre method as well as other fourth-order time integration schemes. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the new integrators.},

It has been developed on top of PETSc and enforces the same programming paradigm.The emphasis of the software is on methods and techniques appropriate for problems in which the associated matrices are sparse, for example, those arising after the discretization of partial differential equations. Therefore, most of the methods offered by the library are projection methods such as Arnoldi or Lanczos, or other methods with similar properties. SLEPc provides basic methods as well as more sophisticated algorithms. It also provides built-in support for spectral transformations such as the shift-and-invert technique. SLEPc is a general library in the sense that it covers standard and generalized eigenvalue problems, both Hermitian and non-Hermitian, with either real or complex arithmetic.SLEPc can be easily applied to real world problems. To illustrate this, several case studies arising from real applications are presented and solved with SLEPc with little programming effort. The addressed problems include a matrix-free standard problem, a complex generalized problem, and a singular value decomposition. The implemented codes exhibit good properties regarding flexibility as well as parallel performance.},

Universal reconstructions are obtained by distributing unknown and flux points in a geometrically similar manner for all unstructured cells. Placements of these points with various orders of accuracy are given for the triangular elements. Accuracy studies of the method are carried out with the two-dimensional linear wave equation and Burgers’ equation, and each order of accuracy is verified numerically. Numerical solutions of plane electromagnetic waves incident on perfectly conducting circular cylinders are presented and compared with the exact solutions to demonstrate the capability of the method. Excellent agreement has been found. The method is much simpler than the discontinuous Galerkin and spectral volume methods for unstructured grids.},

In this paper, we present a new class of optimal high-order SSP and low-storage SSP Runge--Kutta schemes with s>p. We find that these schemes are ultimately more efficient than the known schemes with s=p because the increase in the allowable time step more than offsets the added computational expense per step.

  abstract = {The spectral analysis is a basic tool to characterise the behaviour of any convection scheme. By nature, the solution projected onto the Fourier basis enables to estimate the dissipation and the dispersion associated with the spatial discretisation of the hyperbolic linear problem. In this paper, we wish to revisit such analysis, focusing attention on two key points. The first point concerns the effects of time integration on the spectral analysis. It is shown with standard high-order Finite Difference schemes dedicated to aeroacoustics that the time integration has an effect on the required number of points per wavelength. The situation depends on the choice of the coupled schemes (one for time integration, one for space derivative and one for the filter) and here, the compact scheme with its eighth-order filter seems to have a better spectral accuracy than the considered dispersion-relation preserving scheme with its associated filter, especially in terms of dissipation. Secondly, such a coupled space–time approach is applied to the new class of high-order spectral discontinuous approaches, focusing especially on the Spectral Difference method. A new way to address the specific spectral behaviour of the scheme is introduced first for wavenumbers in [0,π], following the Matrix Power method. For wavenumbers above π, an aliasing phenomenon always occurs but it is possible to understand and to control the aliasing of the signal. It is shown that aliasing depends on the polynomial degree and on the number of time steps. A new way to define dissipation and dispersion is introduced and applied to wavenumbers larger than π. Since the new criteria recover the previous results for wavenumbers below π, the new proposed approach is an extension of all the previous ones dealing with dissipation and dispersion errors. At last, since the standard Finite Difference schemes can serve as reference solution for their capability in aeroacoustics, it is shown that the Spectral Difference method is as accurate as (or even more accurate) than the considered Finite Difference schemes.},

  abstract = {Characteristic boundary conditions for the Navier-Stokes equations (NSCBC) are implemented for the first time with discontinuous spectral methods, namely the spectral difference and flux reconstruction. The implementation makes use of the resolution by these methods of the strong form of the Navier-Stokes equations by applying these conditions through a flux balance regularization which takes the form of a generalized element-compact correction polynomial. It is shown to be at least as effective as similar implementations in finite volume solvers, and sustains arbitrarily-high orders of accuracy on hexahedral-based unstructured meshes. Further, Navier-Stokes time-domain impedance boundary conditions are derived and implemented as a NSCBC sub-class. They account for the diffusive process at the wall and are shown to properly resolve the broadband response of porous materials under normal and grazing flow conditions. The ability of these NSCBC in preventing the appearance of spurious reflections at the boundaries is demonstrated through a varied series of bench-marking simulations. They effectively shield the inner computational domain from any far-field unphysical contamination. Overall, this work enables the use of strong discontinuous spectral methods to study unsteady problems on complex geometries.},

  abstract = {The attenuation power of an acoustic liner is optimized by unsteady compressible flow simulations that model the presence of the liner with a time-domain impedance boundary condition (TDIBC). Two test cases are considered: a one-dimensional impedance tube and a two-dimensional grazing incidence tube. The impact of the liner on the pressure field is tuned through various TDIBC parameters imposed at the boundary where the liner surface is located. Automatic differentiation of the direct numerical simulation (DNS) code yields the gradients of the time-integrated pressure perturbations with respect to the TDIBC parameters. The gradients are subsequently used in an iterative process that minimizes the perturbations at a given location. In both test cases considered, TDIBC parameters are found which are more effective at attenuating perturbation frequencies other than those the initial TDIBC is designed to cancel. Finally, a sensitivity analysis reveals the importance of the choice of the initial TDIBC parameters for finding optimized settings. Our results pave the way to a wider application of the presented procedure in more complex problems with bulk flow motion and larger perturbation amplitudes.},

  abstract = {In the present paper, a stable Spectral Difference formulation on triangles is defined using a flux polynomial expressed in the Raviart-Thomas basis up to the sixth-order of accuracy. Compared to the literature on the Spectral Difference approach, the present work increases the order of accuracy that the stable formulation can deal with. The proposed scheme is based on a set of flux points defined in the paper. The sets of points leading to a stable formulation are determined using a Fourier stability analysis of the linear advection equation coupled with an optimization process. The proposed Spectral Difference formulation differs from the Flux Reconstruction method on hybrid grids: the distinction between the two approaches is highlighted through the definition of the number of interior flux points. Validation starts from a convergence study using Euler equations and continues with simulations of laminar viscous flows over the NACA0012 airfoil using quadratic triangles and around a cylinder using a hybrid grid.},

  abstract = {An exponential time-integrator scheme of second-order accuracy based on the predictor–corrector methodology, denoted PCEXP, is developed to solve multi-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations pertaining to fluid dynamics. The effective and efficient implementation of PCEXP is realized by means of the Krylov method. The linear stability and truncation error are analyzed through a one-dimensional model equation. The proposed PCEXP scheme is applied to the Euler equations discretized with a discontinuous Galerkin method in both two and three dimensions. The effectiveness and efficiency of the PCEXP scheme are demonstrated for both steady and unsteady inviscid flows. The accuracy and efficiency of the PCEXP scheme are verified and validated through comparisons with the explicit third-order total variation diminishing Runge–Kutta scheme (TVDRK3), the implicit backward Euler (BE) and the implicit second-order backward difference formula (BDF2). For unsteady flows, the PCEXP scheme generates a temporal error much smaller than the BDF2 scheme does, while maintaining the expected acceleration at the same time. Moreover, the PCEXP scheme is also shown to achieve the computational efficiency comparable to the implicit schemes for steady flows.},

  abstract = {Multiphysics problems involving two or more coupled physical phenomena are ubiquitous in science and engineering. This work develops a new partitioned exponential approach for the time integration of multiphysics problems. After a possible semi-discretization in space, the class of problems under consideration is modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations where the right-hand side is a summation of two component functions, each corresponding to a given set of physical processes. The partitioned-exponential methods proposed herein evolve each component of the system via an exponential integrator, and information between partitions is exchanged via coupling terms. The traditional approach to constructing exponential methods, based on the variation-of-constants formula, is not directly applicable to partitioned systems. Rather, our approach to developing new partitioned-exponential families is based on a general-structure additive formulation of the schemes. Two method formulations are considered, one based on a linear-nonlinear splitting of the right hand component functions, and another based on approximate Jacobians. The paper develops classical (non-stiff) order conditions theory for partitioned exponential schemes based on particular families of T-trees and B-series theory. Several practical methods of third order are constructed that extend the Rosenbrock-type and EPIRK families of exponential integrators. Several implementation optimizations specific to the application of these methods to reaction-diffusion systems are also discussed. Numerical experiments reveal that the new partitioned-exponential methods can perform better than traditional unpartitioned exponential methods on some problems.},

The efficiency of exponential-type integrators strongly relies on the fast computation of the action of the exponential of matrices which often change only slightly during the integration.

The classical SD algorithm is shown to be unstable when a multi-species gas where thermodynamic properties depend on temperature and species mass fractions is considered. It is demonstrated that computing primitive variables from conservative variables at solution points and extrapolating them at flux points, rather than conservative variables, make the SD method stable for such case. In addition, a new methodology, more stable, for computing the diffusive fluxes at an interface is detailed. To allow the simulation of combustion, characteristic and wall boundary conditions for multi-species flows in the SD framework are introduced and the thickened flame turbulent combustion model is adapted to the SD context. Validation test cases from one-dimensional and two-dimensional laminar flames to a three-dimensional turbulent flame have been performed showing excellent agreement with each of the reference solutions. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that a 3D turbulent flame is simulated using the SD method. The interest of employing a high-order method, such as the SD, in combustion is demonstrated: high values of the polynomial degree improve the quality of the results which advocates for the use of p-refinement when simulating reacting flows.},
